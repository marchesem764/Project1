        "# Will it be an early Spring?\n",
        "\n",
        "On February 2<sup>nd</sup> every year Punxsutawney Phil makes a prediction about if there will be an early Spring or if Winter will continue for 6 more weeks (till about mid-March). He is however not very accurate (well, according to [The Inner Circle](https://www.groundhog.org/inner-circle) he is 100% correct but the human handler may not interpret his response correctly). The overall goal is to be able to predict if it will be an early Spring.\n",

        "For this project you must go through most steps in the checklist. You must write responses for all items however sometimes the item will simply be \"does not apply\". Some of the parts are a bit more nebulous and you simply show that you have done things in general (and the order doesn't really matter). Keep your progress and thoughts organized in this document and use formatting as appropriate (using markdown to add headers and sub-headers for each major part). Do not do the final part (launching the product) and your presentation will be done as information written in this document in a dedicated section, no slides or anything like that. It should however include the best summary plots/graphics/data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are intentionally given very little information thus far. You must communicate with your client (me) for additional information as necessary. But also make sure that your communications are efficient, thought out, and not redundant as your client might get frustrated and \"fire\" you (this only applies to getting information from your client, this does not necessary apply to asking for help with the actual project itself).\n",

        "Each group from 200-level and 300-level sections with the best results on the 10% of the data that I kept for myself will earn +5 extra credit (if multiple groups are close points may be given to multiple groups)."

        "**1. Define the objective in business terms.**  \n",
        "    ACME Seed company is trying to understand weather patterns for their new corn seed product. The company needs to guarantee if there will be an early spring based upon the farmers product yield. If weather permitting, the farmers can get 2 full harvests with the ACME corn seeds. Our objective is to understand when there will be an early spring and when there won't be.  \n",
        "    \n",
        "**2. How will your solution be used?**  \n",
        "    If our model can successfully predict if there will be an early spring (before March 15th) the company will be able to send out a guarantee for the seeds making sales flourish.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?**   \n",
        "    Current solutions to knowing about early springs are very iffy. Weather is an always changing and hard to calculate thing. We are currently using Farmer's Almanacs, Meterologist Models, and Groundhogs to predict weather trends.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, ...)?**  \n",
        "    This is going to be a Supervised (Regression Based) problem with a most likely offline system. Supervised because of the historical data being put into our model and Regression based because of the dynamic changing rates of weather patterns. On top of this for the moment we are keeping it to an offline system because of the not needed constant input of new data to update.  \n",

        "**5. How should performance be measured? Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?**   \n",
        "    Based on the ideology that we will be trying to guarantee ACME seeds that there will be an early spring. Performance will be measured by the Recall score of our model because of the True Positive nature that guarantees a result. We will disregard false negatives and say with 100% certainty that True Positives will be the best results for both the Company and the Farmers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?**  \n",
        "    Guaranteed Early Springs with very high certainty. There is a slight tolerance for error in missing a few early springs, but in contrast to that we do not want to inform the company that there will be an early spring if it actually in reality is still winter. No direct miminum performance has been classified but we hold high standards.  \n",

        "**7. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?**  \n",

        "\n",
        "**8. Is human expertise available?**     \n",
        "    Humans on their own have almost no ability to be able to predict the weather. there may be Meterologist who know a bit more but prediciting a whole season is not an easy feat.  \n",

        "**10. List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far. Verify assumptions if possible.**  \n",
        "    One assumption could be that we need to wait at least until the beginning of february every year to make the prediction. We must also assume that march 15th will be the date of guarantee every year.  \n",
